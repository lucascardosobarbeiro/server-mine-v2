## üöÄ Overview

This project is a comprehensive case study in modern Cloud Engineering and DevOps, demonstrating the end-to-end creation of a robust, secure, and fully automated multi-world Minecraft server platform on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

The goal transcends simply hosting a game server; it serves as a robust portfolio piece that applies industry-standard practices. The entire infrastructure is managed as code (IaC), and the application's lifecycle is automated by a complete CI/CD pipeline, ensuring the system is not only functional but also resilient, manageable, and professional.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** 100% of the cloud environment (VPC, Firewall, VM, IAM, Storage) is declaratively managed with **Terraform**, ensuring reproducibility and version control.
-   **Full CI/CD Automation:** A **GitHub Actions** workflow automatically deploys application updates upon a `git push` to the `main` branch, eliminating manual intervention and human error.
-   **Multi-Layered Security:**
    -   **Zero Trust Access:** Administrative SSH access is handled exclusively through **Google's Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)**, keeping port 22 completely closed to the internet.
    -   **Network Isolation:** Services run in a custom VPC with granular firewall rules that only expose the proxy.
    -   **Principle of Least Privilege:** A dedicated GCP Service Account with the bare minimum IAM roles required for operation.
-   **Containerized Architecture:** All services (Velocity Proxy, PaperMC servers) run in isolated **Docker** containers, orchestrated on the VM by **Docker Compose**.
-   **Resilience & Professional Operations:**
    -   **Automated Backups:** A `cron` job on the host VM performs daily backups of server worlds to **Google Cloud Storage**.
    -   **Proxy & High Availability:** A **Velocity** proxy acts as a single, secure entry point, allowing players to seamlessly switch between game servers and protecting backend servers from direct access.
    -   **Centralized State Management:** Terraform's state is managed by a **Remote Backend** on GCS, enabling collaborative and safe infrastructure management.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The platform is designed with a focus on security, automation, and separation of concerns. The high-level architecture can be visualized as follows:

### How It Works

  - **User Inputs:** The **Player** connects to the server via the single, publicly exposed port `25565`. The **Administrator** interacts with the system by performing a `git push` to the repository.
  - **Automation:** The `git push` triggers the **CI/CD Pipeline** in GitHub Actions.
  - **Secure Connection:** The pipeline authenticates with GCP and establishes a secure SSH connection to the **VM** through a **secure IAP Tunnel**, keeping the instance isolated from the public internet.
  - **Internal Orchestration:** Inside the VM, the **Docker Engine** manages the containers. Player traffic arrives at the **Velocity Proxy**, which then routes them to the appropriate **Game Servers** over a private, internal Docker network.
  - **Data Persistence:** The VM itself runs a scheduled `cron` job to push world data backups to a **Cloud Storage Bucket**, ensuring data safety.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To deploy this project, you will need to have the following tools installed and configured.

### Prerequisites

  - A Google Cloud Platform account with billing enabled.
  - [Terraform CLI](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) (`v1.0.0+`).
  - [Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) authenticated with your account (`gcloud auth login`).
  - A GitHub repository to host the project code.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Configure Terraform Variables**
    Create a file named `terraform.tfvars` by copying the example file.

    ```bash
    cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
    ```

    Now, edit `terraform.tfvars` and fill in your specific project details (GCP Project ID, email, etc.).

3.  **Deploy the Infrastructure**
    Run the following commands from the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    # Initialize the Terraform providers
    terraform init

    # (Optional) Review the execution plan
    terraform plan

    # Apply the configuration to create the infrastructure in GCP
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    After the apply is complete, Terraform will output the server's public IP and other important values.

4.  **Set Up GitHub Secrets**
    The `terraform apply` command will output the values for `workload_identity_provider` and `service_account_email_for_github`.

      - In your GitHub repository, navigate to **Settings \> Secrets and variables \> Actions**.
      - Create two new repository secrets:
          - `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`: Paste the value from the Terraform output.
          - `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: Paste the service account email from the Terraform output.

The project is now fully deployed, and the CI/CD pipeline is active and ready.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use

### For Players

  - **Server Address:** To connect, use the public IP address in your Minecraft client:
    `[YOUR_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS]` (Replace with the IP generated by Terraform).
  - **Navigation:** Once in the Lobby, use the commands `/server sobrevivencia` or `/server criativo` to switch between worlds.

### For the Administrator

  - **Administrative Access (SSH):** Access to the virtual machine is handled securely following a Zero Trust model. Instead of relying on static SSH keys, IAP authenticates every connection based on the user's identity and IAM permissions.
